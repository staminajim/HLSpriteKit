/**
 Returns true if the passed gesture recognizers are of the same type and are configured in
 an equivalent way (dependent on class).

 For example, if the two passed gesture recognizers are both `UITapGestureRecognizers`
 configured with the same number of required taps and touches, then this method will
 return `YES`.

 Use case: Gesture targets return a list of gesture recognizers to which they might add
 themselves.  It is then the responsibility of the gesture recognizer delegate (usually an
 `SKScene` or view controller) to add gesture recognizers to the view.  But if the
 delegate already has an equivalent gesture recognizer added, then there's no need to add
 another.  This method can be used to decide what counts as "equivalent".

 @bug Might be worth comparing and contrasting with `[UIGestureTarget isEqual:]`.

/**
 A generic target for gesture recognizers.

 "Gesture recognizer" refers under iOS to `UIGestureRecognizer` and under macOS to
 `NSGestureRecognizer`.

 ## Usage

 A single delegate for a bunch of gesture recognizers creates and maintains the
 recognizers, but wants to forward the gesture to different targets based on where the
 gesture starts.  An example might be an `SKScene`, which has only a single view (and
 hence only a single set of gesture recognizers), but perhaps many different `SKNode`
 components within the scene, like a world, a character, or a toolbar.  Upon receiving the
 initial location of a particular gesture, the `SKScene` finds likely `HLGestureTarget`
 components and offers them the chance to become targets of that gesture.  See `HLScene`
 for a simple implementation.

 Note that `HLGestureTarget` is a protocol.  This allows a number of implementation
 patterns:

 1. A small scene might be the gesture target for all its components.  (This is pretty
    much the same as having the gesture delegate, that is, the scene, do all the gesture
    handling also; the small advantage would be a natural way to split handling methods by
    topic, for instance `handleWorldTap:` and `handleToolbarTap:`.)

 2. A scene's functionality might be split out into custom `SKNode` subclasses; in that
    case, each custom node might be its own gesture target and do its own gesture
    handling.

 3. A scene (or custom `SKNode` subclass) might create a default `SKNode` instance,
    without subclassing, and can configure it for simple gesture interaction by attaching
    an out-of-the-box `HLGestureTarget` using `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget
    hlSetGestureTarget]`.  For example:

        SKSpriteNode *myButton = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWith...];
        [myButton hlSetGestureTarget:[[HLTapGestureTarget alloc] initWithHandleGestureBlock:^{
            NSLog(@"tapped button");
        }]];

 ## Ad Hoc Gesture Targets: Benefits and Dangers

 Implementation (3), above, describes a usage pattern that allows ad hoc creation of
 interactive nodes, without subclassing.

 It can be nice to do this for a simple one-off popup: a message, perhaps, or an extremely
 simple configuration dialog.

 Say I want to create a popup message with a single Done button, in an ad hoc fashion.
 Easy.  (I'm leaving out the sizing and positioning code so it doesn't distract from the
 logic.)

     SKSpriteNode *alertNode = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithColor:[SKColor blueColor] size:CGSizeMake(200.0f, 180.0f)];

     HLMultilineLabelNode *labelNode = [[HLMultilineLabelNode alloc] initWithFontNamed:@"Helvetica"];
     labelNode.text = @"Something happened, and you should know about it.";

     HLLabelButtonNode *doneButton = [[HLLabelButtonNode alloc] initWithColor:[SKColor blackColor] size:CGSizeMake(80.0f, 40.0f)];
     doneButton.text = @"Done";

     [alertNode addChild:labelNode];
     [alertNode addChild:doneButton];

     __weak SKSpriteNode *alertNodeWeak = alertNode;
     [doneButton hlSetGestureTarget:[HLTapGestureTarget tapGestureTargetWithHandleGestureBlock:^(UIGestureRecognizer *gestureRecognizer){
       [alertNodeWeak removeFromParent];
     }]];
     [self needSharedGestureRecognizersForNode:doneButton];

     [self addChild:alertNode];

 But already it's a bit of a pain setting up the tap gesture block with a weak reference
 (in order to avoid a retain cycle on `alertNode`).  And it can quickly get much more
 complicated when there is more to do in the block: for instance, reading user input
 values from the dialog, or having separate "Okay" and "Cancel" buttons.

 Anyway, the point is: `HLSpriteKit` allows ad hoc gesture targets, which is nice, but in
 many instances subclassing (or at least delegation) makes things much simpler and easier
 to understand.

/// @name Adding to Gesture Recognizers

/**
 Adds itself (as target of an action) to the passed gesture recognizer if it is interested
 in the particular gesture at the given location (in scene coordinates).

 Returns `YES` if added; this helps the caller determine if any of its targets care about
 the gesture.  The target adds itself with a call like this:

     [gestureRecognizer addTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];

 The implementation of this method should assume that it is not already added as a target
 to the gesture recognizer.  (It is typical for the caller to clear all targets from the
 gesture recognizer before then offering it to be claimed by one or more of its possible
 targets for the given location.)

 Returns an additional boolean indicating whether the location is "inside" the target
 (regardless of whether the target added itself to the gesture recognizer).  This value is
 important so that the caller can decide whether or not to offer the gesture to other
 targets.  A common example is a button target given a pan starting inside the button: The
 button does not care about pans, and so does not add itself as a target to the gesture,
 but it returns `isInside` `YES`, so the caller knows that the pan should probably not
 fall through to other targets.  (This could be separated out as a separate method in
 `HLGestureTarget`, but the logic is often computationally redundant with the decision to
 add self as target.)  (Also, as an motivating example: If all targets were `SKNode`s and
 the caller could use `containsPoint` to determine whether a gesture location was "inside"
 a particular target, then the target wouldn't have to weigh in.  But clearly a hit test
 inside a bounding box is not always sufficient; it depends on the target.)  Typically,
 all gesture locations passed to a gesture target's implementation of this method can be
 assumed to be inside the target (because of the caller's logic), unless the gesture
 location falls into some space of the target which is considered invisible (from a user's
 point of view).

 To explain the logic, here is a sketch of a typical caller implementation.  The caller is
 a delegate of a number of standard gesture recognizers.  It has many possible targets for
 the gestures, some of which are controlled completely by the caller, and some of which
 are encapsulated into opaque components.  The motivating example is reusable subclasses
 of `SKNode`, which can't own their own gesture recognizers, since they aren't views
 (`UIView` or `NSView`).  On first recognition of a gesture recognizer
 (`gestureRecognizer:shouldRecieveTouch:` in iOS or
 `gestureRecognizer:shouldAttemptToRecognizeWith:` in macOS), the caller might use
 bounding box (e.g. `[SKNode containsPoint]`) or other hit testing (e.g. `[SKNode
 nodeAtPoint]`) to find possibly-relevant targets, and then query them in order of visible
 layer height (e.g. `[SKNode zPosition]`): each target is asked to add itself to the
 gesture if it's interested.  A caller might decide to only offer the gesture to the first
 target that claims the gesture is "inside"; or, it might decide to offer the gesture to
 all targets at a location regardless of layer height and opacity.

 Some callers might also be able to use these to avoid unnecessary calls to `addToGesture`
 (which is assumed to be more costly), but typically not: A target still must evaluate "is
 inside" for all gestures, even if it doesn't handle some of those gestures.

 A block that will be executed when the gesture target is tapped.

 Beware retain cycles when using the callback to invoke a method on the node that owns
 this gesture target.  A common example is creating a node that dismisses itself when
 tapped:

     [myNode hlSetGestureTarget:[HLTapGestureTarget tapGestureTargetWithHandleGestureBlock:^(UIGestureRecognizer *gestureRecognizer){
       [myNode removeFromParent];
     }]];

 In the example, `myNode` retains its gesture target, which has a block retaining
 `myNode`.  This can be rewritten to retain the node weakly:

     __weak SKNode *myNodeWeak = myNode;
     [myNode hlSetGestureTarget:[HLTapGestureTarget tapGestureTargetWithHandleGestureBlock:^(UIGestureRecognizer *gestureRecognizer){
       [myNodeWeak removeFromParent];

 If the weak reference is mentioned more than once, then it might need to be made strong
 again inside the block:

     __weak SKNode *myNodeWeak = myNode;
     [myNode hlSetGestureTarget:[HLTapGestureTarget tapGestureTargetWithHandleGestureBlock:^(UIGestureRecognizer *gestureRecognizer){

       if (myNodeStrongAgain.parent) {
         [myNodeStrongAgain removeFromParent];
       }
     }]];

 An easier way to avoid retain cycles is to use the delegate interface of
 `HLTapGestureTarget`; see `delegate`.
